* User Authentication
* How can I add the deck to the search results?
* Mobile friendly
* Improve search options
* Add publisher/developer and genre information.
* Is it better to continue pulling from the API, or minimize the times you pull from it?
* Add webapp start animation akin to pulling a physical game off a shelf.
* As this app evolves from simple wishlist into a full game cataloging app, we need to update options to add to library/wishlist/etc.
